The overhead of integrating a Fast Weight Programmer is difficult to justify. The difficulty of integration,
combined with the small improvement seen from my experimentation gives no evidence to the general superiority
of FWPs over a decision matrix. I have observed that by the end of the testing games the FWP begins to give
answers substantially fast and more precisely than the decision matrix, this indicates that given memory
retention the FWP would continuously increase accuracy.
